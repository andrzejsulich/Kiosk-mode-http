To make the script work, you would need to:
Compile or Convert the Script: You must use a third-party tool (like an PowerShell-to-EXE converter) to turn the Launch_Webpage.ps1 script into a standalone executable file (e.g., MyWebScreen.exe).

Rename the Executable: You then need to manually rename the compiled file from MyWebScreen.exe to MyWebScreen.scr.

Install: Copy the renamed .scr file to the C:\Windows\System32 folder.
